# Statistics-with-Excel
Tutorial for using Excel for statistical analysis in my courses

Excel is a wonderful tool to do simple statistical analysis. You do not need any complicated software like SPSS. These tutorials will tell you how to do specific statistical analysis in Excel. I have listed them in the order in which they appear in the Analysis Tools in Excel.
- Installing the analysis tool pack in Excel
- Descriptive statistics. https://easyexceltips.com/descriptive-statistics/        practice file
- Anova single factor. It concludes whether two data sets are related to each other or not by conducting an analysis of variance.
   - Performing anova in Excel. https://easyexceltips.com/anova/    practice file
   - Excel anova test.   https://easyexceltips.com/anova-test/   practice file
- Anova: Two-Factor with Replication        This is the extension of Anova: Single Factor. It concludes whether two data sets are related to each other or not by conducting an analysis of variance. The only difference here is that it can include more than one sample of data for each group. https://easyexceltips.com/anova-two-factor/    practice file
- Anova: Two-Factor Without Replication        It concludes whether two data sets are related to each other or not by conducting an analysis of variance. However, this analysis tool does not include more than one sample of data for each group. https://easyexceltips.com/anova-two-factor-without-replication/     practice file
- Correlation        Correlation determines the degree to which two paired variables are in relationship to each other. https://easyexceltips.com/correlation/    practice file
   - Correlation calculation: data relationship assessment. https://easyexceltips.com/correlation-in-excel/
   - calculating correlation in Excel. https://web.archive.org/web/20250328130850/https://easyexceltips.com/correlation-in-excel-2/
- Covariance        Covariance measures the change in one variable when the other variable changes. Covariance can be positive or negative. https://easyexceltips.com/covariance-calculation/
- Descriptive Statistics        This tool calculates a range of statistical computations and compiles them into an excel table. This table includes calculations for mean, mode, median, sum, standard deviation, error, largest, smallest, sample variance, kurtosis, count, range, min, max etc. https://easyexceltips.com/descriptive-statistics/
- Exponential Smoothing        This tool is used to smooth the data i.e, more weightage is given to recent data files.  https://easyexceltips.com/exponential-smoothing/
- F-Test Two Sample for Variance        An F-Test is used to compare two population variances. The null hypothesis is that the variances of the two populations are the same. https://easyexceltips.com/f-test/
- Fourier Analysis        Fourier Analysis resolves problems in linear systems and examines periodic data by using DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) method or FFT Fast Fourier Transform) method. https://easyexceltips.com/fourier-series/
- Histogram. Histogram tool allows the user to create data distributions and histogram charts. https://easyexceltips.com/histogram/
- Moving Average        Moving average is used with time series data i.e. data taken over time like electricity expenditure over days or stock price of company ABC over time or units sold of item A etc. It is used to smooth out the short-term fluctuations (or maybe seasonal fluctuations) and highlight longer-term trends.  https://easyexceltips.com/moving-average-formula/
- Random Number Generation        It is used to generate a random number of different types such as Discrete, Uniform, Normal, Bernoulli, Poisson, Patterned, etc. https://easyexceltips.com/random-numbers/
   - Randomizing your data. https://easyexceltips.com/rand-function/
   - Randomizing between specific numbers. https://easyexceltips.com/randbetween-function-in-excel/
   - Random numbers between zero and one. https://easyexceltips.com/rand-function/
- Rank and Percentile        This tool constructs a list of the numbers ordered from highest to lowest and gives a percentile value that shows how a specific number ranks compared to the other numbers.
  - Rank. https://easyexceltips.com/excel-rank-function/
   - percentile. https://easyexceltips.com/calculate-percentile/
- Regression        Regression is used to estimate relationships between 2 or more variables â€“ a dependent variable and independent variable(s). In simple terms, the independent variables form an equation which helps in estimating the value of the dependent variable. https://easyexceltips.com/regression-analysis/
  - Performing regression analysis. https://easyexceltips.com/regression-analysis-in-excel/
  - Multiple regression. https://easyexceltips.com/multiple-regression/
  - P value calculation in regression. https://easyexceltips.com/p-value-calculator/
- Sampling        The Sampling tool is used to produce a data sample population either randomly or periodically.
- t-test https://easyexceltips.com/how-to-test-statistical-significance-by-t-test/
  - t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means        This analysis tool is used to test the null hypothesis for two Paired samples.
  - t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances        This analysis tool is used to test the null hypothesis for two Paired samples with equal means.
  - t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances        This analysis tool is used to test the null hypothesis for two Paired samples assuming unequal variances.

- Z-Test: Two-Samples for Mean        Z-Test is used to compute the means of two data samples with known variances.
